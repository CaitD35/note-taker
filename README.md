# note-taker

## Description 

This challenge was to create a application called Note Taker so a user can write and save notes. This application uses Express.js and will save and retrieve data from a JSON file.

When the user opens the application they are presented with a landing page and link to a notes page. When the user clicks the link they are presented with a page of notes listed on the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and text on the right-hand column. 
The user can enter a new note title and text of their choice and then can save the data when they click on the save icon that appears in the top page navigation. 

## The following images show the web applications appearance and functionality.
